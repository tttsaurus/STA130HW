    "# Proposal 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\"Is there an association between cultural orientation and body self-image in the Canadian population?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Cultural Orientation (PSYCH_cultural_orientation_scale)** (_categorical, ordinal_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Aggregate scores for collectivism and individualism subscales.\n",
    "    - Perform a correlation analysis between these cultural orientation scores and self-image factors.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Heatmap of correlations between cultural orientation subscales and body self-image factors.\n",
    "  - Justification: This approach can help illustrate if there are particular cultural values that correlate with self-image perceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Body Self-Image (PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Compute averages or sums of self-image subscale scores.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Scatter plots with trend lines to display the relationship between cultural orientation and self-image.\n",
    "  - Justification: Comparing self-image measures across cultural orientation scales may provide insights into whether cultural factors influence body image perceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "A simple correlation analysis will determine if there is an association between cultural orientation dimensions (e.g., collectivism and individualism) and body self-image factors. Alternatively, a multiple linear regression model could assess the joint effect of different cultural orientations on body self-image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We expect that higher collectivist orientation scores may correlate positively with self-image measures, indicating a possible link between collective cultural values and positive body perceptions.\n",

    "# Proposal 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\"Is there a relationship between personality traits (such as extraversion, agreeableness) and social dependency in Canadian adults?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Personality Traits (PSYCH_ten_item_personality_inventory & PSYCH_big_five_inventory)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Calculate composite scores for each trait (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness).\n",
    "    - Examine their association with social dependency using correlation and regression.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Scatter plots with regression lines showing relationships between individual personality traits and social dependency scores.\n",
    "  - Justification: Understanding these relationships can help determine if certain personality traits predispose individuals to greater social dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Dependency (PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_social_dependence_score)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Use multiple linear regression with personality traits as predictors.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - A regression summary plot showing the impact of each personality trait on social dependency.\n",
    "  - Justification: This analysis enables examination of multiple predictors simultaneously to identify specific personality traits related to social dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "A multiple linear regression will assess how personality traits, such as agreeableness and extraversion, predict social dependency scores. Each personality trait score will act as an independent variable, with social dependency as the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "It is hypothesized that higher levels of agreeableness and extraversion will be positively associated with social dependency, potentially due to these traitsâ€™ association with social-oriented behaviors.\n",

    "# Proposal 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\"How do cultural orientations relate to self-esteem scores among Canadians?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Cultural Orientation (PSYCH_cultural_orientation_scale)** (_categorical, ordinal_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Group participants into high and low scores for collectivism and individualism dimensions.\n",
    "    - Use these dimensions as predictors in a regression model.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Scatter plots with trend lines comparing self-esteem scores across cultural orientation levels.\n",
    "  - Justification: This analysis can help illustrate differences in self-esteem linked to cultural orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Esteem (e.g., scores from PSYCH_big_five_inventory or other self-related inventories)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Simple linear regression of self-esteem on cultural orientation dimensions.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Bar plots or scatter plots showing average self-esteem across cultural orientation categories.\n",
    "  - Justification: A linear model can demonstrate the extent to which cultural orientation scores predict self-esteem levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "A multiple linear regression model will be used to analyze the effect of different cultural orientation dimensions (collectivism and individualism) on self-esteem scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We expect that individuals with higher collectivist orientation scores may report higher self-esteem, as these individuals might experience greater social support, potentially reinforcing their self-perceptions.\n"
