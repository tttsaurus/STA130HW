    "\"Is there a linear association between the age and survival status among passengers on the Titanic?\" (dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- Age (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore: \n",
    "    - Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for each survival group (survived or not survived)\n",
    "    - Apply Simple Linear Regression model to `Age` and `Survived` with an indicator variable since `Survived` is a binary variable\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Histogram of `Age` for each survival group. Justification: the histogram describes the overall distribution so we can have a basic idea of a certain age range that associates to survival status\n",
    "    - Box Plot of `Age` for each survival group. Justification: the box plot clearly shows the interquartile range that associates to survival status. Moreover, we can have the both box plot on the same graph where x-axis represents `Survived` and y-axis represents `Age`, which provides more insights\n",
    "    - Scatter Plot of `Age` against `Survived` with regression lines. Justification: it provides a nice overview since we can see each data point and the overall shape\n",
    "  - Reason to choose: `Age` is an interesting demographic feature that associates to many other outcomes\n",
    "- Survived (_binary_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Apply Simple Linear Regression model to `Survived` and `Age` as mentioned\n",

    "    - Histogram of `Survived`. Justification: we can have an overview of survival status\n",
    "    - Scatter Plot of `Survived` against `Age` with regression lines as mentioned. Justification: it provides a nice overview\n",
    "  - Reason to choose: `Survived` is the major outcome in the Titanic dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "I plan to apply Simple Linear Regression Model to analyze the potential linear association between `Age` and `Survived`. Specifically, I will separate `Age` into two groups like `Age < 18 or Age > 50` as `Group1` and `Age ≥ 18 and Age ≤ 50` as `Group2`, and my linear regression model will be like $Y_i=β_0+1_{[\"Group2\"]}(k_i)*β_1+ε_i$ (`Survived` stands for `Y` and `Age` which is `Group1` and `Group2` stands for the indicator variable `k`). For the hypothesis testing, it will be like $H_0$: $|β_1|$=0 (no linear association: about the same survival rate for each group), $H_1$: $|β_1|$>0 (`Group2` has a higher survival rate than `Group1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "I assume we will probably have enough evidence to reject $H_0$, which implies that there is a linear association between `Age` and `Survived`. Moreover, `Group1` will probably have a lower survival rate but `Group2` has a higher one, which is a phenomenon under $H_1$.\n",

    "  - `Year` is more like an auxiliary variable and everything related it is described in the `Temperature`'s section\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
