    "# Proposal 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\"Is there an association between cultural orientation and body self-image in the Canadian population?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Cultural Orientation (PSYCH_cultural_orientation_scale)** (_categorical, ordinal_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Compute averages or sums of some collectivism and individualism subscales for each data point so we can eliminate categories, or otherwise remain the categories for other purposes (make sure that high number refers to positive and low number refers to negative so accumulation works).\n",
    "    - Perform a linear regression analysis between these cultural orientation scores and self-image factors.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Heatmap of correlations between cultural orientation subscales and body self-image factors.\n",
    "  - Justification: This approach can help explain if there are particular cultural values that associate with self-image factors.\n",

    "- **Body Self-Image (PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Compute averages or sums of self-image subscale scores.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Scatter plots with trend lines to display the relationship between cultural orientation and self-image.\n",
    "  - Justification: Comparing self-image factors across cultural orientation scales may provide insights into whether cultural factors associate body image factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "A simple correlation analysis can be applied to determine if there is an association between cultural orientation and body self-image factors. Alternatively, a multiple linear regression model could be handy on how different cultural orientation categories (collectivism and individualism) associate body self-image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "I expect that higher collectivist orientation scores may correlate positively with self-image measures, indicating a possible link between collective cultural values and positive body perceptions.\n",

    "# Proposal 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\"Is there a relationship between personality traits (such as extraversion, agreeableness) and social dependency in Canadian adults?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Personality Traits (PSYCH_ten_item_personality_inventory & PSYCH_big_five_inventory)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Calculate composite scores for each trait (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness).\n",
    "    - Examine their association with social dependency using regression.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Scatter plots with trend lines showing relationships between individual personality traits and social dependency scores.\n",
    "  - Justification: Understanding these relationships can help determine if certain personality traits associate to social dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Dependency (PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_social_dependence_score)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Use multiple linear regression with personality traits as predictors.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - A regression plot showing several correlation lines between each personality trait and social dependency.\n",
    "  - Justification: This analysis enables examination of multiple categories simultaneously to identify specific personality traits related to social dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "A multiple linear regression will assess how personality traits, such as agreeableness and extraversion, associate social dependency scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "It is hypothesized that higher levels of agreeableness and extraversion will be positively associated with social dependency, potentially because these traitsâ€™ association with social stuff.\n",

    "# Proposal 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\"How do cultural orientations relate to self-esteem scores among Canadians?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- **Cultural Orientation (PSYCH_cultural_orientation_scale)** (_categorical, ordinal_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - There are collectivism and individualism subscales.\n",

    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Scatter plots with trend lines comparing self-esteem scores across cultural orientation levels.\n",
    "  - Justification: This analysis can help illustrate association in self-esteem linked to cultural orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Esteem (e.g., scores from PSYCH_big_five_inventory or other self-related inventories)** (_continuous_)\n",
    "  - How to explore:\n",
    "    - Multiple linear regression of self-esteem on cultural orientation subscales.\n",
    "  - Visualizations:\n",
    "    - Bar plots or scatter plots showing average self-esteem across cultural orientation categories.\n",
    "  - Justification: A linear model can demonstrate the extent to which cultural orientation scores predict self-esteem levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "A multiple linear regression model will be used to analyze the effect of different cultural orientation categories (collectivism and individualism) on self-esteem levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "I expect that individuals with higher collectivist orientation scores may report higher self-esteem, as these individuals might experience greater social support.\n"
