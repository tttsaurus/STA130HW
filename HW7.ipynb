    "- The relatively low percentage of the model's explanatary power suggests that the model doesn't capture all factors that influence the dependent variable. In other words, there are some unobserved predictors.\n",
    "- For coefficients, the strong evidence against the null hypothesis suggests that the predictor variables have a meaningful association with the outcome. In other words, the predictors chosen are quite \"correct\".\n",
    "- This contradiction can exist because low $R^2$ and high p-value of coefficients are not mutually exclusive. We can conclude that we chose correct predictors but there are still some unobserved predictors when this contradiction happens.\n",

    "- Model 3 & 4 to Model 5\n",
    "  - Model 3 is a simple linear regression with two predictors, `Attack` and `Defense`, predicting `HP`\n",
    "  - Model 4 expands Model 3 by adding more predictors  (e.g., `Speed`, `Legendary`, etc.)\n",
    "  - Model 5 incorporates categorical variables like `Generation`, `Type 1`, and `Type 2`. It's like adding the indicator variables to our formula. These variables help capture categorical effects that could further explain variations in `HP`\n",
    "- Model 5 to Model 6\n",
    "  - Model 6 uses specific indicator variables for certain categories\n",
    "  - e.g. `I(Q(\"Type 1\")==\"Normal\")` and `I(Q(\"Type 1\")==\"Water\")` are indicator variables for the `Type 1` categories `Normal` and `Water`\n",
    "  - Model 6 is more focused on specific categories\n",
    "- Model 6 to Model 7\n",
    "  - Model 7 changes the sign from `+` to `*`, which includes all interactions among these continuous variables\n",
    "  - As a result, Model 7 is more complex with interaction terms that capture how predictors interact with each other\n",
