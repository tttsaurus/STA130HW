For example, I used Python's list comprehensions for filtering and selection for Monty Hall problem. List selection can be complicated and confusing if I was searching it on the Internet. However, GPT told me what's happening with one Q&A.\n",

    "I always believe ChatBot is helpful for studying new stuff since it's a model trained using everything from the Internet. Therefore, what GPT tells you is highly conclusive and complete although can be wrong. My perception of AI-driven assistance doesn't change since I joined the STA130 course. I feel more determined about the fact that AI-driven assistance is helpful after I finished some STA130 assignments. GPT has helped me to learn Python since I only did C++, C#, and Java before, and I feel I just smoothly migrated to Python with GPT's help. In my opinion, GPT has clear reasonings which are especially helpful for coding, and this is why I migrated to Python quickly."
